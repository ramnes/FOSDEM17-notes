Natanael Copa (Alpine founder, works at Docker)

original idea of Alpine : running without disk (install in RAM) (2006)

started with Gentoo (and uClibc)

2008 drop Gentoo

problems with uClibc:
- based on libc
- ugly codebase
- upstream not responding

musl:
- active
- clean codebase
- stable ABI
- libc compatible
- supports utf-8
- lightweight simple free
but
- vew few others had tried (sabotage linux)
- a lot of software assumes libc, how much to patch?

but it gone suprisingly well
2014 3.0.0 up

musl code gets better and better

if you want to be compatible with musl:
- no __MUSL__ define
- default thread stack size 80k (Windows 1Mb, glibc 8Mb, lol)
- be careful with glibc extensions
- strerror_r with two different prototypes, lol
- DNS resolver works differently (send request to all nameservers and get the first response, rather than asking one by one)
- DNS "search" keyword doesn't work

being compatible with musl often make the code better
