your files are your value, everything else can be recreated

What is does: FS snapshots, and when disaster happens, reinstall and apply snapshots just as before

it's not intended to use for system migrations:
- no different hardware
- no different architecture

not in competition with configuration or migration tools

Relax-and-Recover (rear)
- disaster recovery framework
- not a backup tools, but complements it (uses tar by default)
- meant for experienced users
- has a cli + config file, no GUI
- written in bash
- may need to be adapted for your use case

The recovery system is a bootable image
