unikernel failover? what if no more memory (no virtual memory)?

grep 'vmxlsvm' /proc/cpuinfo

hypervisor on OSX sucks

deferpanic.com can help you
gdb also

networking not so easy for develops

immutable filesystem? hard (tmpfiles, uploads)

unikernel = one process = no ssh :)

interpreted languages = you don't have to rebuild your whole image each time, just attach your code

virgo = cli for unikernel, feels like docker

ecosystem is pretty new, lots of things to do
