kubernetes is really easy to use to scale stateless applications

but what about persistent stuff (databases, etc)?

extend kubernetes with a manifest that describe the whole application system ecosystem, built with "operators"

CoreOS' operators are third party resources that store the metadata of complex ecosystem

operators are allowing non-stateless applications to scale (almost) as easily since they represent the human operational knowledge

let's make a MongoDB operator? :)
