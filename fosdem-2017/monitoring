different sorts of monitoring:
- graphing
- alerting
- more?

all old software:
- graphing: MRTG then RRD from the 90s (Graphite and Munin are/were based on it)
- alerting: Nagios from 1996

we need to consider more data sources, such as logs and browser events

avoid alerts than could easily have false positives, or they will be ignored
typical example: alerting on CPU usage, and then logrotate makes it 100%

human attention is limited
alerts should only relate to actuel enduser problems

there's a tradeoff in every monitoring system
