data efficiency

RocksDB fork of levelDB at the origin
MyRocks = RocksDB as a storage engine for MySQL

why myrocks:
- storage efficiency
- better write efficiency
- good read efficiency (might be slower for queries but that's the tradeoff)
- effective with SSD and disks

For an important web-scale workload:
- Uses 50% the space vs compressed InnoDB
- Uses 25% the space vs innoDB
- Write rate to storage is 10% the InnoDB rate

When to consider MyRocks:
- You are using InnoDB
- The database is larger than RAM

But:
- almost no documentation for now
- no community
- some performances can be improved
