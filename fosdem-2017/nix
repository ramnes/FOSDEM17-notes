nix is not only an OS, it's a whole lot of tools (nix, nixos, disnix, hydra, nixops)
they all have in common to be declarative

nix package manager:
- generic
- reproducible
- reliable
- efficient

even your OS installation can be declared

every package is in isolation from each other (hashcode in prefix of any installation)

nix packages are also declarative

since no one can remember the hashs, you need to use a wrapper -> profiles (sets of sympoblic links)
changing version of a package is just changing a symlink

garbage collection = removing paths that are no longer reachable from a profile (nix-collect-garbage)

no difference between build dep and run dep, just deps

also see yarn and ied

do you know if there were expirements to run the nix package manager on other distributions than nixos

nix can runs on any distribution, even BSD or OSX
nix is on portage :D
