The intention of Grafana was not infrastructure monitoring, but it's the most common use-case

originally used for user metrics

then support from influxdb

grafana 2.0 get its backend (in go, with any SQL)

official support from prometheus cloudwatch elastic 

http://play.grafana.org/dashboard/db/stats

interesting to use dots for 95th percentile so it's here but less present
interesting to fill between min and max to see how the average is calculated

time series as tables, could we have a use?

you can template variables that are queried from graphite!

there are shortcuts: e to edit

you can publish Grafana snapshot

interesting plugins:
- worldmap plugin can map timeseries to geo points
- diagram panel
- simplejson-datasource: use grafana with any old system

grafana.net:
- lots of plugins
- lots of premade dashboard
- add your own :)

future of Grafana:
- high availability
- dashboard folders, with permissions and so on
- backend plugins (to support more notifications systems, other databases, etc)
- automation
