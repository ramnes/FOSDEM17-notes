connect people with local business

142 million monthly unique visitors
77 million reviews

only one repository yelp-main
new abstraction without removing the old ones
as Yelp grew, become a big bottleneck

everyone push the same project in production multiple times a day

solution : modularize
---------------------

each service is developed and deployed independently
a service is small, covering only one aspect or feature

easier to paralelize async so speed up

problems
--------

consistency is really hard
no clear usage graph
need to maintain interfaces

-> "acceptance testing" 
docker-compose to test everything together (that can be heavyweight)

stack
-----

uwsgi pyramid sqlalchemy
http json
swagger
aggregator for REST APIs (not really an aggregator, just every service aggregate by itself by manually calling http to other services)

mobile development
------------------

you can't update the client with the API, so maintaining multiple API versions


monitoring
----------

ElastAlert
Crashlytics
PagerDuty
