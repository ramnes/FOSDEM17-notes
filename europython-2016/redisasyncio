based one the echo TCP server example from the doc
one Transport and one Protocol instances created per client connected
Protocol methods are just callbacks, not coroutines

a Transport is basically just a connection/socket to a client

DB was put apart so it doesn't know anything about asyncio
pub sub is basically just a client broadcasting to all other clients connected to the same channel
implemented with a shared channel object
blpop = clients gettings the message one by one 
type.MUST_WAIT to answer from a callback that has to block, then catching it and creating a coroutine so we don't block the event loop

await implies a yield, and it's resumed when needed
