the "community" word has bad days
community work = technical work
"came for the language, stayed for the community"

Python community:
- inclusive: safe, respectful, open
- contributions welcome (even from newbies

PSF members:
- basic (non-voting)
- supporting (giving money)
- contributing (organizing anything, open source software)
- fellows

PSF moneys comes from supports, sponsors and PyCon US mainly
Then it goes to events all around the world (PSF pays for meetups)

Challenges:
- IoT, mobile, GIL
- perception
- wider community
- growth: scaling, distributing

"Think globally, act locally"
