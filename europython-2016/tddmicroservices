idependant and cooperating
12 factor

unit tests doesn't check if the whole stuff works
-> tests the entire application locally

you can mock (wiremock, pretenders, mountebank)

"verified fakes" are interesting
use docker for the whole architecture

functional tests == service tests == component tests

TDD:
+ confidence
+ automation
+ ward off bad design
but requires:
- discipline
- tools

use docker python client to automate architecture for tests
mountepy

other people commits in a TDD
- test coverage (fail_under = 100 is nice, parallel = true is awesome, pylint)
- contract tests, ie swagger, will help you automising your service tests
