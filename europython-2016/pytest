py.test becomes pytest on next version

use yield_fixtures and parametrize!

fixtures also support params

use plugins for company specific things (see cookiecutter-pytest-plugin for an example)

hackebrot.github.io/pytest-tricks

- --fixtures to list all fixtures and their docstrings

new features:
- approx(): floats comparisent
- doctest_namespace test documentation
- name
- pytest.mark.parametrize (and the parameters "ids" makes it even better)
- --fixtures-per-test
- pytest warnings summary is shown by default (--disable-pytest-warnings)
- lots of deprecations

blog.pytest.org

docs.pytest.org -> examples (good practices should be shown here)
-> no dos and don't dos, but if you feel that something is missing, talk to us
-> don't put fixtures in conftest, it has side effects
