Container live migration: Transferring a running container from an host to another
Parasite code is injected on the process after it's stopped, it dumps memory to disk, then it's being removed from the process
clone3 in Kernel 5.5 allows you to create a process with a certain PID
CRIU
Docker has CRIU in experimental mode but is not maintained anymore so not sure how it works
Podman has it also now since 2019, was a lot of work in selinux, runc, etc
podman container checkpoint
Make the checkpoint while running
Used in Borg by Google, not yet planned for Kubernetes but that's presenter end goal (needs work on cri-o most likely)
Presenter is very very knowledgeable
