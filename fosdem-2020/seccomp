Seccomp intercept syscalls and accept or deny them
seccomp notify in 5.0 asks a userspace proccess if the syscall can be done (needs libseccomp)
lxc implement it for mknod and mount for example
For now changing seccomp profile needs a container restart
lxc looks fun, I should play more with it
Can be used to "invent" syscalls that are handled uaerspace (i.e. as a communication pipeline to lxc for example)
