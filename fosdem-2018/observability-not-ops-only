devops vs opsdev 
observability is what makes developers initerested in the ops world and make them opsdev 

think business on your infrastructure and production
tests, benchmarks and exceptions aren't enough

what data to collect to gain confidence in your releases?

feature flags are great
graphs per feature flags

canary deployment vs feature flags

be able to query data to validate or invalidate hypotheses about the root cause
of any problem

collect business relevant metrics (customer ids, etc)

add custom fields for validating hypotheses

prune stale fields if necessary

best with contextual and structured data, consistent naming
