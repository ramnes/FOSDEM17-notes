go execution model (goroutines rather than thread) makes it difficult to debug
with traditional tools because you can switch between different contexts
(goroutines are multiplexed across threads)

Mozilla RR seems very nice, can help you debug bugs that only happen sometimes
by recording every frame and its context and then replaying everything so that
if you succeed to trigger a bug once, you can then debug in a deterministic
meaner.

dlv replay can run RR records and debug on them
