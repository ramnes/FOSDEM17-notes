based on appc (quid of OSI support?)
no daemon, just a CLI
there's a "fly" stage1mode in which you can run a container without any kind of isolation (just a chroot)

CRI defines a Runtime interface, that kublet uses to talk with rktlet via gRPC

rkt seems to rely a lot (too much?) on systemd, wether it's for running it, or to run processes insides containers (?!) 

coming next:
- CNI 0.6.0
- runc for stage2?
- casync?
- native OCI support? (it exists but is currently integrated in Docker compatibility and needs conversions)
- performance
- pass more k8s e2e conformance tests
