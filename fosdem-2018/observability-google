Google has 10ks of micro service (100s of team)

how to find out what's the root cause of a problem across multiple services?

use tags everywhere (trace originator=analytic if a requests comes from the
analytics service)

opencensus.io

being able to see the timeline of every service used for a request is awesome

raw vs aggregate

serviceability must be holistic and use different signal types
