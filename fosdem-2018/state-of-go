Go 1.10 adds the following features:
- tests now cache tests results if FS doesn't change (or stuff like that)
- tests can now output in json so that you don't have to parse
- Three-index slicing?
- continue and break inside templates loops
- Strings.builder
- unicode ("mindblown" emoji is so cool)
- no improvments in performance, but compiler is faster
