Content-Adressable data SYNChronization tool

file system tree synchronizer
think git + rsync

can be used for backup
good for CDN
can act at the block layer or the file system level
uses catar, which is basically the same as tar but reproducible
buzhash algorithm (to split into chunks)
zackstd (compression algorithm)

if you reduce the chunk average size, then you improve the change of chunk
reusability, right? what's the tradeoff, and how to choose that zie?

squashfs?

the chunck algorithm allows random access to different parts of an image, which
mean that a single directory can be extracted from an image

future:
- caching: make repeated image generation cheap
- chunking: tewak the chunking
- backup
- auto, secure $HOME sync
- crypto
