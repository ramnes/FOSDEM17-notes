prometheus has arbitrary multi-dimensionnal labels (as opposed to Graphite, for example, which has kind of "folders" you have to know the structure about)

Prometheus is meant to be reliable: each server is independant and only relies on local SSD

no clustering or attempts to backfill "missing" data

Disk write divided by 100 between Prometheus 2 and 3
