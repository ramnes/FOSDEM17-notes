kubelet evicts aggressive pods first (the ones that use the most resources out of there request)

vertical pod autoscaler (VPA):
- obeserves usage
- recommend requests
- optional auto-change

updater modes:
- off
- initial: only changes requests when pod restarts
- auto: evicts / recreate pods

right now k8s makes pod spec resources requests immutable (change means restart)
what if job was running for two hours and then you realize it has not enough resources

cgroups implementation of resources reporting is not perfect and very precise

spec.container.resizePolicy: NoRestart, RestartContainer (e.g. JVM application, that allows all the RAM at the beginning) or RestartPod

KEP686

will a modification of the pod spec in a deployment template trigger a rollout?
