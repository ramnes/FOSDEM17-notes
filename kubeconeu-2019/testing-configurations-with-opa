Unit testing your Kubernetes configuration using Open Policy Agent
Gareth Rushgrove, director @ snyk.io

OPA is low-level policy engine (Rego language) and can be used on several use cases / gatekeeper uses it behind the scenes
shift-left testing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_left_testing

local development is always faster than CI or cluster
OPA is usually used in the cluster as an Admission Controller or so, what if it could be used on local development as well?

conftest
https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest

$ conftest test deployment.yaml

you can unit test your policies in Rego as well

Rego is pretty new, not much code available online

conftest is experimenting with OCI registries mediaTypes to host OPA policies

yaml vs cue for k8s configurations

working on a kubectl plugin, installable with krew
$ kubectl conftest deployments
$ kubectl conftest deployment some-deployment

can be used for any structured data, not just YAML+k8s
terraform plans, docker compose, etc (ansible!)
