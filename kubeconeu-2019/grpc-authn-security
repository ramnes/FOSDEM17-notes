gRPC microservices: authentication and security
Jan Tattermusch @jtattermusch / Google

make insecure options explicit

authn options:
- per rpc: tokens in metadata / secure transport
- channel level: tls, mutual tls, alts (requires builtin support from gRPC)
- "transparent": trusted proxy that does encryption/auth for you

sending token with each RPC usually not an efficiency problem:
- tokens are reused for multiple requests
- hpack (http2)

mtls is great but certificate distribution + rotation is a pain
istio makes it transparent
