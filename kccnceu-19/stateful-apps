trade-off:
- accessibility: does it needs to be on the same node?
- availability
- durability
- access mode: how many nodes can access the volume concurrently?

other characteristics: performance, cost

most cloud providers don't persist VMs local disks

spread replicas with failure domains + anti-affnity
failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io

storages now provide their topology with the volume topology feature

kubectl taint node <node> <effect>

node fencing
statefulset recovery can be long

gke has the node autorepair feature
