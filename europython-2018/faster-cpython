just an experiment, not in production nor upstream

at startup, lots of time spent importing modules and creating small objects

pyc creation is made with the marshal module

used C99 initializers feature to get rid of the unmarshaling overhead of frozen modules
if I get it correctly, they basically they generate the code at CPython compile time rather than startup time

bench, written in Haskell, kinda like timeit but generic

emacs unexec function
