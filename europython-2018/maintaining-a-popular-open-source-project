It's a struggle to have a legal entity to receive funding money for an open-source project when contributors are all around the world

Popular open-source projects attract users at a faster rate than contributors
------------------------------------ contributors -------------- maintainers
Thousands of users, hundreds of contributors, 5 maintainers

Use a CoC that matches your project and enforce it
Set project expectations

Make your project easier to contribute to
Write good documentation, for different users (new comers, users, contributors)
Be welcoming, show empathy

Each changes need the documentation and tests

Maintaining backward compatibility becomes increasingly
Dealing with distributions and package managers is hard

Say no

"We needs this at work": very frustrating
"Can you simply...": same

Please do a patreon and we'll give money - then no-one gives

Don't use commits emails, it's shady
