how does Python take the code you've written and executes it

lexical analysis
tokenization : cutting things in small exploitable things
(there's a "tokenize" module)
INDENT/DEDENT tokens

then parsing (AST creation)

then compile into bytecode (code object that Python can run)
(compile builtin function)
dis.code_info to see what's in the code object
code.co_code contains the code bytes

bytes are regrouped by pairs
instruction + argument

dis.get_instructions to get the meaning of those bytes

then CPython puts things in cache
uses marshal for it

python -m inspect inspect :)
